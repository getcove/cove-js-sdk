## Development Workflow

We use a Git flow with two main branches:
- `develop`: Integration branch for new features and fixes
- `main`: Production-ready releases only

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch from develop:**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes and test:**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev        # Start development mode
   pnpm test       # Run tests
   pnpm check      # Run type checking and linting
   ```

3. **Add a changeset:**
   ```bash
   pnpm changeset
   ```
   - Select the packages you've changed
   - Choose the version bump type (major/minor/patch)
   - Write a meaningful description for the changelog

4. **Commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: your feature description"
   ```
   
   Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
   - `feat:` New feature
   - `fix:` Bug fix
   - `docs:` Documentation changes
   - `chore:` Maintenance tasks
   - `refactor:` Code refactoring
   - `test:` Test updates

5. **Push and create a PR:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feat/your-feature-name
   ```
   Then open a PR from your branch to `develop`.

### Release Process

Releases follow a two-stage automated process to prevent branch divergence:

**Stage 1: Version PR (develop branch)**
- When changesets are pushed to `develop`, GitHub Actions automatically creates a "Version PR"
- This PR contains version bumps and CHANGELOG updates
- Review and merge this PR back into `develop`

**Stage 2: Publish (main branch)**
- Create a PR from `develop` to `main` with all changes including versions
- When merged to `main`, GitHub Actions automatically:
  - Builds all packages
  - Publishes to npm
  - Creates git tags

This ensures `develop` and `main` stay in sync with no divergent commits.
